"""GUI package for SOC Audit Framework.

This package provides a graphical user interface for the SOC auditing framework,
allowing analysts and auditors to run scans, view findings, and export reports
without using the command line.

The GUI is designed as a thin wrapper around the existing engine, preserving
the CLI-first design and modular architecture.
